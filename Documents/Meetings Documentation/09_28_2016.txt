Marko: Should we try for Wednesday midday?                         
Marko: I've missed tests and presentations and I know they'll probably fall on Thursday and Friday of this coming week if varsity opens but I'm not sure what times                   
Liron: Well both should be fine for me. You 2 just need to decide                         
Jason Chalom: Wednesday should be fine. I do have stats from 2-3 and info systems 10-12                         
Marko: He emailed us last night, not sure if you guys saw. Sprint review 3 meetings will take place between 12 and 14 October                    
Marko:                      
Jason Chalom: yeah thats what we are talking about                         
Jason Chalom: 12 october is a wednesday                         
Marko: Oh I though you guys meant Wednesday Thursday or Friday of this coming week                         
Marko: I should be chilled then for anyday                         
Jason Chalom: I dont come in on Fridays                         
Jason Chalom: Maybe Thursday at luch would be best                         
Liron: I agree                         
Liron: I'll email him then                         
Jason Chalom: I hate automated systems like UJ enrollment ... it keeps crashing ...
