Â Marko:Â Sup guys, just another quick one. I didn't document the administrator as an external user, admins would count as internal actors of the system right?                         
Jason Chalom:Â Admins are external                         
Marko:Â Also, does the traceability matrix go into the AD document?                         
Jason Chalom:Â Maybe both                         
Â Marko:Â Ok sick.
How can I describe the connection of the system to the database? ðŸ™ˆ                         
Â Jason Chalom:Â As an api                         
Â Jason Chalom:Â You don't have to spec mongodb                         
Â Jason Chalom:Â Just show it as an external system                         
Â Jason Chalom:Â I do use mongo for some computation
