Jason Chalom: then write my essay                        
Marko: Jason, where are the requirements you listed in the traceability matrix written?                        
Jason Chalom: ?                        
Jason Chalom: I never wrote that                        
Jason Chalom: The requirements I wrote are in the analysis                        
Marko: Oh did Liron do it? There's a traceability matrix in a excel doc in the documents folder                        
Jason Chalom: The requirements are in issues on github                        
Marko: The thing is that they're numbered in the matrix so I don't know which one is which and we have to list them                        
Jason Chalom: I did write them as a list in the one doc                        
Jason Chalom: not the ios                        
Jason Chalom: iso                        
Marko: Uhh                        
Marko: There aren't any requirements listed in the ISO doc bro                        
Marko: You're talking about the architecture description document?                        
Jason Chalom: no dude the other one                        
Jason Chalom: yeah                        
Marko: There are 13 functional requirements in that doc                        
Marko: But 19 requirements in the matrix                        
Jason Chalom: oh well look at github                        
Liron: I added some extra ones in the extended use case doc                        
Jason Chalom: coo                        
Liron: Maybe I forgot to add then to the req analysis doc                        
Jason Chalom: busy with admin user and reports stuff                        
Jason Chalom: make sure it got staged                        
Jason Chalom: Ive noticed some files wont stage                        
Liron: I added them long ago                        
Jason Chalom: got overridden?                        
Marko: Oh sorry they are in that doc
