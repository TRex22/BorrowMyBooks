Liron: Hey Marko. We both forgot our laptops so we were able to move our sprint to tomorrow at 10:30                        
Marko: Oh shit, ok that's chilled                         
Liron: I hope that's ok                        
Marko: There's a messed up voice note going around about how they're going to stone cars and shit tomorrow                    
Liron: I heard. But the water cannon will say otherwise                        
Marko: I just don't want my car to get hit, I paid for that shit on my own
